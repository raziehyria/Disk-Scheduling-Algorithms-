# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms-

Write a program that implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms:

    FCFS
    SCAN
    C-SCAN

Your program will service a disk with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 4,999. The program will generate a random series of 1,000 cylinder requests and service them according to each of the algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as a parameter on the command line) and report the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm.
